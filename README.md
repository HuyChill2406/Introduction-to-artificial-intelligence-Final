# Introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-Final
Final project for the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at Ton Duc Thang University, consisting of three tasks:

## Task 1 – 8×8 Tic-Tac-Toe with Alpha-Beta Pruning (my work):
Developed a console-based game where the player competes against the computer on an 8×8 board, aiming for 4 in a row. Implemented optimal move selection using the alpha-beta pruning algorithm for efficient decision-making.

## Task 2 – N-Queens Solver with CNF & Glucose3 (my work):
Created a solver for the N-Queens problem by encoding constraints into CNF form and solving them with the Glucose3 SAT solver. Supports any N ≥ 4, with automatic constraint generation and solution visualization.

## Task 3 – Decision Tree for Academic Rank Classification: 
Implemented a decision tree model using Pandas and Scikit-learn to classify academic ranks based on multiple score attributes. Includes entropy, average entropy, and information gain calculations, along with tree visualization.

This project showcases search algorithms, SAT-based problem solving, and machine learning for classification.
